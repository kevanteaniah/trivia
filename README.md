<h1>Trivia Smivia</h2>



 Trivia Smivia is trivia game that covers many categories. The categories range from childhood favorites, to everyday common knowledge. Two friends came up with the idea of a trivia game after attempting to play Scrabble, but finding many of the pieces missing in their game set, so started trying to come up with ideas for a different game.
